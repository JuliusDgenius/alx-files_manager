Steps to Obtain Facebook API Keys for a Company:

1. Create a Meta Developer Account:
   - Visit Meta for Developers: https://developers.facebook.com/
   - Sign in with your Facebook account
   - Register as a developer if you haven't already

2. Create a Business Account:
   - Go to Meta Business Suite: https://business.facebook.com/
   - Create a new business account or use an existing one
   - Ensure you have admin access to the business account

3. Create an App:
   - In the Meta Developers Console, click "Create App"
   - Choose "Business" as the app type
   - Fill in the app details, including the company name and contact information

4. Link the App to Your Business Account:
   - In the app settings, link the app to your business account
   - This ensures that the app is recognized as part of your company's operations

5. Get Your App Credentials:
   - After creating the app, you'll receive an App ID and App Secret
   - These credentials are used to authenticate API requests

6. Configure App Settings:
   - Set up the necessary permissions and features your app will use
   - Complete any required app verification processes, especially if you need access to sensitive data

7. Submit for App Review:
   - If your app requires specific permissions (e.g., accessing user data), submit it for review
   - Provide detailed information about how your app will use the data

8. Implement Security Best Practices:
   - Store your App ID and App Secret securely
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive information
   - Regularly review and update your app's security settings

9. Compliance and Policies:
   - Ensure your app complies with Meta's platform policies
   - Stay updated on any changes to the API or policy requirements
